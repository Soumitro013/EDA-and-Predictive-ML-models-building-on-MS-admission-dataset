As we are studying MS, we know the amount of pressure someone has to go through during  MS admissions, there are different requirements for the admission process and after meeting  them all one will get a chance into the MS course of a certain University and In this project,  we have taken the dataset of graduate admissions and our goal is to find out some important  features from this dataset through Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and then we applied  machine learning classifiers on this data to observe which model best fits this data. Weâ€™ve  applied five ML classifiers namely, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,  Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes.
